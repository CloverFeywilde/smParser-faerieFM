This is my custom proprietary script to convert Stepmania SM files to JSON files usable in faeri
e.FM. The purpose of this project is to streamline my development pipeline, and make stage creation for the game far simpler and more time effective.

Usage: run from the BASH command line 
    node smReader.js yourfile.sm

make sure you are CD'd into the correct directory when you type the above code in, that the SM file you wish to convert is also in the same directory, and lastly, make sure you have node.js installed.
